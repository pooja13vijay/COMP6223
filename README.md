Assignments and Notes for COMP6223 module
<h1>Coursework 1</h1>
Created hybrid images from scratch by first convolving an image with Gaussian filter to create low pass filtered image. Then another high-pass filtered image was obtained by subtracting the original image with low pass filtered version of that image. These 2 images are added together to obtain final hybrid image. The high frequency part of the hybrid image dominate perception when it is available while low frequency part of the hybrid image can be seen at a distance.

<h1>Coursework 2</h1>
Viola-Jones Haar Cascade algorithm is a type of algorithm that can be used to detect faces in images based on weakly discriminative features that may or may not be present in images of faces. In this project, methods to camouflage the face in order to not be detected by the algorithm were done and the results were described in a report.

<h1>Coursework 3</h1>
This project involved a classification task with 100 training images and 15 distinct labels. 3 different classifiers were run in order to correctly classify the training and testing data. The final run managed to obtain an accuracy of 69% on training data using SVM classifier.
