Assignments and Notes for COMP6223 module
<h1>Coursework 1</h1>
Created hybrid images from scratch by first convolving an image with Gaussian filter to create low pass filtered image. Then another high-pass filtered image was obtained by subtracting the original image with low pass filtered version of that image. These 2 images are added together to obtain final hybrid image. The high frequency part of the hybrid image dominate perception when it is available while low frequency part of the hybrid image can be seen at a distance.
